# Freadbear's Family Dinner Tycoon
A game about stepping into the shoes of William Afton, but in an alternate version, where you're not a serial killer, but rather a dedicated restaurant manager alongside Henry Emilly. Inspired by: FNAF Tycoon (Cancelled) on Gamejolt; FNAF Pizzeria Simulator by Scot Cawton.
